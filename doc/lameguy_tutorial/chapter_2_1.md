# 2.1. The Principles of PlayStation 3D

Among the most defining features of the PlayStation when it first
debuted in 1995 was its ability to handle 3D graphics in real-time and
was among the first consoles that *really* brought real-time 3D visuals
to the home console scene. Something that was previously only really
seen in arcades and personal computers of the time. This chapter will go
over the 3D graphics architecture of the PlayStation to fill-in the
programmer to better grasp the chapters that follow in this section.

Also of note, these chapters expect the programmer to posses prior
knowledge of at least some level of 3D graphics programming, so one may
want to brush up on the basics of 3D geometry elsewhere before
proceeding.

## The PlayStation 3D Graphics Architecture

In contrast, the graphics architecture of the Nintendo 64 has a stronger
resemblance to modern graphics processors such as floating-point
matrices and vectors, perspective correct texture mapping with bilinear
mip-map filtering and hardware depth buffer.
