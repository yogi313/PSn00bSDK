# Lameguy\'s PlayStation Programming Series

> [!CAUTION]
> Lameguy's PlayStation Programming Tutorial Series was written with
> older versions of PSn00bSDK in mind and is outdated at this point,
> but may still be useful as an introduction to the console's hardware
> and the basics of the graphics and controller APIs.

Welcome to Lameguy64\'s PlayStation Programming Series! This is a series
of tutorials I (Lameguy64) put together in my spare time that covers the
basics and eventually, more advanced topics of programming for the
original PlayStation.

Keep in mind that this tutorial series assumes you already have prior
experience in C programming as PlayStation specific programming topics
are only covered here. If you\'re completely new to programming in
general it is recommended to learn C first from a different tutorial
series.

## About this tutorial series

I decided to work on this tutorial project to help make PlayStation
homebrew programming a little more accessible even though this is likely
not going to change much on the state of the PS1 homebrew scene and that
nobody has bothered to write good programming tutorials that I\'m aware
of that don\'t just use libgs right at the start, usually with very
little explanation to how the hardware works which in my opinion is not
the right way to teach how to program for the target platform.

The pages are written in plain HTML with minimal CSS styling for
compatibility with older browsers so you can conveniently view the pages
on your Windows 98 PC that has a DTL-H2000 or similar development
hardware equipped.

## Why is this a SVN repo and not a wiki or blog series?

Because it is easier for me to update, easier to run, accessible on very
old web browsers and I rather self-host my stuff whenever possible.
Wikis and things like wordpress can get bent.
